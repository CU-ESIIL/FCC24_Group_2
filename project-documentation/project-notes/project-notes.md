# Project discussion notes

## Virtual meeting #3
Full team did not meet/attend. 

### Team theme, tentative area of interest, or question:
Our team's interested in GEDI data, assessing canopy heights and how they are changing due to disturbance events - how effective GEDI is at identifying disturbance. 

## Day 1: March 12, 2024 - CU Boulder
Brainstormed scientific questions to tackle:
- How effective is GEDI data and GEDI + imagery-based ML models?
- Can we visually detect forest disturbances with GLAD ARD data? 
- Can we detect insect outbreaks using GEDI or satellite imagery?
- Can we predict the spread of insect outbreaks in forests, and predict the amount of damage?
- Can we use ML to assess fire risk for a given area, given fuel availability, and other environmental covariate factors?
- Is this type of detection easier with Landsat or GEDI data?

### Selected scientific question: 
Can we visually detect forest disturbances with GLAD ARD data? 

## Day 2: March 13, 2024 - CU Boulder
- Started working with [GLAD](https://glad.umd.edu/ard/home) (using Landsat dataset, harmonized from frame-to-frame), downloaded data and started creating GIFs for visualizing using Landsat band combinations such as RGB, and NIR (Len)
- Exploring GEDI csv data through example (Mihir and Mike)
- Exploring TreeMap data, disturbance stack, GEDI height products from GEE (Sarah)
- Exploring Landfire disturbance data (Mike): trying to export a GIF of Landfire disturbance data.

## Day 3: March 14, 2024 - CU Boulder
